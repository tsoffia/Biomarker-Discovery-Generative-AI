# Biomarker-Discovery-Generative-AI
Welcome to the Biomarker Discovery Using Generative AI repository! This repository serves as a centralized collection of research papers, articles, and resources focused on the application of generative artificial intelligence in the field of biomarker discovery. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and accessible resource for researchers, scientists, and enthusiasts interested in exploring the potential of generative AI technologies in identifying and validating biomarkers.

Biomarker discovery is a critical area in medical research, providing valuable insights into disease mechanisms, diagnostics, and therapeutic targets. With the advent of generative AI, new methodologies and models have emerged, offering unprecedented capabilities in data analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling. This repository aims to gather and organize seminal and cutting-edge research works that demonstrate the integration of generative AI techniques in biomarker discovery processes.

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have relevant papers, tools, or resources to share, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
